/**
 * Given the previously created class called BibleBook that maintains
 * fields for the book name, number of chapters in the book, and short
 * summary of book contents, create a program that generates an array
 * of BibleBooks representing all of the Books in the New Testament
 * of the Bible. You should read the Bible Book data in from a FileFile
 * format should be the following one book per line: Book name: number
 * of chapters:summary. Submit a link to your code on GitHub along with
 * the self evaluation.
