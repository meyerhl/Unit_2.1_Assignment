# Unit_2.1_Assignment

Please view the ReadFile file for programming code.
Please view the BibleData_File for the results of raw data.

The purpose of this project was to create a program that generates an array of
BibleBooks representing all of the Books in the New Testament of the Bible.
Read that data in from a FileFile format which should contain one book per
line with the book name, number of chapters, and a summary.
